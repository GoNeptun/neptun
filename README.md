## Overview

Neptune is a  dynamic content framework written in Go.
This is an independent project written from scratch. But we are inspired by the large number of templates created for [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/) and came up with the idea of preserving the standard for data output and template functions seted by Hugo. Thus, Neptune is 70% adapted to the expansion of templates written for Hugo
